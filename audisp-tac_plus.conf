#  Install this file as /etc/audisp/audisp-tac_plus.conf
#  Servers are tried in the order listed, and once a server
#  replies, no other servers are attempted, unless acct_all=1
#  is given, in which case, the accounting message is sent to
#  all TACACS+ servers.
# 
#  This configuration is similar to the libpam_tacplus configuration, but
#  is maintained as a configuration file, since audisp doesn't
#  support passing parameters.  Parameters must start in the first
#  column, and parsing stops at the first whitespace
#  The server IP address can be optionally followed by a ':' and a port
#  number (server=1.1.1.1:49)

# if set, errors and other issues are logged with syslog
#debug=1

acct_all=1

# use any variables set in /etc/tacplus_servers to simplify configuration
include=/etc/tacplus_servers
#additional servers, or instead of /etc/tacplus_servers
#secret=tacacskey
#server=192.168.1.1

# If the management network is in a vrf, set this variable to the vrf name.
# This would usually be "mgmt"
# When this variable is set, the connection to the TACACS+ accounting servers
# will be made through the named vrf.
#vrf=mgmt

# It is recommended that you don't change this default
