audisp-tacplus v1.0.0
June 22, 2016

This audisp module has is designed to do TACACS+ accounting,
using a plugin to auditd/audisp.  It uses the libsimple_tacacct
send_tacacs_acct() interface to send TACACS+ auditing records for users that
are TACACS+ authenticated through the modified lipam_tacplus
package.  It also requires libtacplus_map library to lookup mappings

It was written to work with a modified version of pam_tacplus
that allows tacacs users to authenticate login without
a local account in the password file, by mapping to to
tacacs0...tacacs15 local users.

The plugin maps the auid in the accounting record to a tacacs
loginname, based on the auid and sessionid.

It makes a new connection to the TACACS+ server each time, because libtac
is single threaded.  libtac doesn't support multiple connects at the same
time due to use of globals, and it doesn't have support for persistent
connections at this time.

Only the TACACS+ accounting functions are used.

You can do simple testing, assuming auditd has been running, and
"interesting" events have been logged, most particularly exec
system calls, via the auditctl command or audit.rules:
    auditctl -a entry,always -F 'auid>1001' -S execve -F success=1
    auditctl -a exit,always -F 'auid>1001' -S execve -F success=1
    # run some commands with loginuid >= 1001.
    ausearch --start today --raw > test.log
    ./audisp-tacplus < test.log

Up to 240 bytes of command name and command arguments will be sent
in the accounting record, due to the 255 byte tacacs+ field length
limitation.

It is based on version pam_tacplus version 1.3.9.
It uses the libtac.so shared library from a modified libpam_tacplus
package.

Accounting  performed using TACACS+ protocol [1], designed by Cisco Systems.
This is remote AAA protocol, supported by most Cisco hardware. 

There are two configuration files, one for the plugin (normally
/etc/audisp/plugins.d/audisp-tacplus.conf), and one for the tacacs+
server configuration (normally /etc/audisp/audisp-tac_plus.conf; a different
file can be configured in audisp-tacplus.conf).
Additionally, there is an auditctl rules file, (normally
/etc/audisp/plugins.d/audisp-tacplus.rules) loaded by the audisp-tacplus
init.d script (debian/init.d).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recognized options in the configuration file are the same as the command line
arguments for libpam_tacplus, but not all pam_tacplus options are supported.

Option		Management group        Description
--------------- ----------------------- ----------------------------------
debug           ALL                     output debugging information via
                                        syslog(3); note, that the debugging
                                        is heavy, including passwords!

                                        secret key used to encrypt/decrypt
                                        packets sent/received from the server

server=HOSTNAME auth, session           can be specified more than once;
server=IP_ADDR                          adds a TACACS+ server to the servers

                                        default is 5 seconds

login=STRING    auth                    TACACS+ authentication service,
                                        this can be "pap", "chap" or "login"
                                        at the moment. Default is pap.

acct_all        session                 if multiple servers are supplied,
                                        audisp_tacplus will send accounting
                                        start/stop packets to all servers
                                        on the list, otherwise only to the
                                        first responding server.

service         account, session        TACACS+ service for accounting

protocol        account, session        TACACS+ protocol for accounting

The last two items are widely described in TACACS+ draft [1]. They are
required by the server, but it will work if they don't match the real
service authorized :)
in this directory.

The audisp-tacplus plugin has only been compiled and tested on
debian wheezy and jessie at this writing.

This plugin has only been tested with the linux tacacs+ server, but
it requires very basic functionality, so it should work with other
tacacs+ servers.

See the libpam_tacplus README for more information on the tacacs
protocol.
