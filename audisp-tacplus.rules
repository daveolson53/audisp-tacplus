# This file contains the auditctl rules that are loaded
# whenever the audit daemon is started via the initscripts.
# The rules are simply the parameters that would be passed
# to auditctl.  This file can be loaded with
#   auditctl -R audisp-tacplus.rules
# In debian wheezy, it can be installed in /etc/audisp/plugins.d 
# and it will be loaded when audispd starts.
# In debian jessie, it needs to be installed into /etc/auditd/rules.d
# and then run the augenrules program.  This package assumes jessie,
# and installs into the jessie location, and attempts to run augenrules
# in the postinst

# Do not use -D in this file!  This file is loaded after
# auditd.rules

# The following rules are for TACACS+ accounting with audisp-tacplus
# don't write audit records for process where auid isn't set (-1), or for
# "system" uids, including "cumulus"
# We want to catch exec and exit for the start and stop accounting

# Use the "tacplus" key for ease of use with ausearch, etc.
# We assume here that user 1000 is the first local user, and therefore
# should not be looked up for tacacs.  You may need to change this for
# your local configuration
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -S exit -S exit_group -F auid>1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k tacplus
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -S exit -S exit_group -F auid>1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k tacplus

# In newer distributions (such as debian jessie), a number of auditing events
# are logged by default even after the -D initialization.  If you are using
# auditing only for TACACS+ accounting, you may want to include the rules below, to
# reduce the growth of the audit log.  EXECVE is needed in order to get the args
# to the exec syscall so we can send them to accounting.
