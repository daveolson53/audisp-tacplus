audisp-tacplus (1.0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * API change to support new user_homedir config variable.
  * dropped dependency on libsimple-tacplus, it isn't used any more.
  * Reimplement VRF support using bind to vrfname
  * Fix abort() when sent SIGHUP in some cases
  * When recursing into an included config, don't reset
    secret key index
  * Fixed to run when management network is in a vrf.
    New config file item "vrf" to set vrf name.  Required because audit
    service starts prior to networking, and for networking restart.
  * New Enabled: added config variable "timeout" to limit time attempting to
    connect to non-responding TACACS server.
  * Fixed issues with ordering of multiple servers and secrets in config files.
    libraries can connect to a TACACS+ server without being tacacs aware.
  * Minor corrections to Copyright and licensing
  * When re-using a secret key for multiple servers, strdup, don't copy; fix segv
