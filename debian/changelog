audisp-tacplus (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release of audisp plugin to do TACACS+ accounting.
    It has multiple configuration files, but typically they will work out of
    of the box.   This plugin uses the libsimple-tacct library to communicate
    with the TACACS+ server.  It also requires libtacplus_map library to lookup
    TACACS+ mapping.  Accounting is done on the login_auid and sessionid fields.
